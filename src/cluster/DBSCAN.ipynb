As I have long said, Fake News does not pay!!!\n",". @CNN should move Fredo back to the morning slot. He was rewarded for bad ratings with a much better time slot - and again got really bad ratings.

People want LAW, ORDER & SAFETY!\n","Do not believe the Fake News Media. Oklahoma speech had the highest Saturday television ratings in @FoxNews history. @seanhannity dominated T.V. with my interview on Thursday night, more than @CNN & MSDNC COMBINED. These are the real polls, the Silent Majority, not FAKE POLLS!\n","Congratulations to @foxandfriends on completely dominating the just released morning TV Ratings. Morning Joke, staring Psycho Joe Scarborough on MSDNC, a Concast Company, was a disaster. Even worse was the barely registering @CNN mess!\n","Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia, which was obviously written by his handlers. Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything, but especially Russia!\n",". @FoxNews weekend afternoons is the worst! Getting into @CNN and MSDNC territory. Watch @OANN & @newsmax instead. Much better!\n","President Trump Approval Rating in the Republican Party at 96%. Thank You!\n",". @FoxNews gladly puts up the phony suppression polls as soon as they come out.

I hope not! If it were the other way around, 50 years for treason.

Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\n","Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb.

Sorry, but Cryin’ Chuck Schumer will never let that happen!\n","....No Republican Senate Judiciary response, NO “JUSTICE”, NO FBI, NO NOTHING.

No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!\n","Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders.

In any event, that’s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!\n","....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse.
